# LearningDaisyField
I'm working through the different features of the daisy field

I am working through the examples and getting stuff working - this code is a simple modification of the wavplayer.cpp example

If you want to display the file name you'll need to tweak the wavplayer.h source to allow access to file_info_[].name 

In this example I only had a single wav file on the SD card - I struggled to get this to work for far to long before realizing that I had did not have a compatible format on my SDCard - double check that if you're having trouble!
